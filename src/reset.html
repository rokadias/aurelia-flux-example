    <p>
      The issue is that the VM will no longer receive events from the dispatcher
      after it's deactivate has been called. You can click on one of the parent routes
      in the list above and the event cycle will work. Attempting to click on another will
      fail as the VM has been removed from the Dispatcher 'listener list'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the 'grandchild.js' will show the method:
      <code>
        <pre>
         @handle(PlanActionConstants.PLAN_SELECTED)
          handlePlanSelected(message, plan) {
            logger.debug('Received event: ', message);
            logger.debug("This will only get invoked this one time == bug.", plan);
            this.plan = this.planStore.currentPlan;
          }
      </pre>
      </code>
      <br />
      This method will be invoked only once, even though the store is emitting the correct
      event (see the console).
